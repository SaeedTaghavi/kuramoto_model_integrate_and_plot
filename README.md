# kuramoto_model_integrate_and_plot

This repository provides Python code to perform numerical integration via odeint from scipy.integrate of the Kuramoto Model, which is a network of coupled non-identical phase oscillators. We also configure and present some figures suitable for publishing.

The Kuramoto vector field is defined in network_of_oscillators_Kuramoto_model.py and its parameters are loaded from the /parameters folder.

The examples can be found at run_integrate_measure_and_plot.ipynb.

Examples of the usage of these figures in a latex document are provided in /tex_example (see tex_example/Example.pdf)
